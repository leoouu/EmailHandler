Description
This project allows the submission and processing of resumes in PDF and DOCX formats, filtering them based on user-provided keywords. It also supports processing resumes received via email.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Email client (such as Outlook)

Installation
Download the ZIP file.

To use this new version of the project, run the following commands in the command prompt:

sh
pip install pymupdf
pip install python-docx
pip install python-dotenv
After that, open the "ALTERE O CAMINHO!!" text file in Notepad and modify the seventh line to update the path where the main project folder is located.

Example: "C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\Repository\Project"

Then, click Save As, choose any name but ensure it ends with .bat (e.g., "Program.bat").

Once saved, simply run the .bat file, and the program will start correctly!

(This setup only needs to be done once. From the second time onwards, just open the .bat file you created to launch the program.)
